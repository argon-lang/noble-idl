# Noble IDL

Noble IDL is an interface definition language.
It is designed to support multiple languages and translate between them.
This enables applications to be built in multiple languages, with type safe interface boundaries.

Noble IDL is also designed to be used with [ESExpr](https://github.com/argon-lang/esexpr/) to define cross-language serialized data formats.

Note: Noble IDL is a work in progress.
See [some test cases](noble-idl-compiler/tests/compile_output/noble-idl/test.nidl) for an example.
